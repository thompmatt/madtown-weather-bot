# madtown-weather-bot
A Twitter bot that provides daily weather information for Madison, Wisconsin ([@MadtownWeather](https://twitter.com/MadtownWeather)).

Makes use of the [Tweepy](https://docs.tweepy.org/en/stable/) package (Version 4.8.0) to access the Twitter API and the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/) to extract precise weather information. Uses a cron job for timely updates.

Any suggestions on how to improve the bot can be left [here](https://t.co/c2svRa510f).

## Potential features
- Tweet more frequently (4 times a day, every 3 hours, etc.)
- Personalize the bot, add quotes and/or interesting information to make it more personal. (e.g. message related to a Wisconsin Badgers football game day on a Saturday)
- Respond with current weather when a user tweets keyword at bot account.
